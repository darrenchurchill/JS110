### Question 6

How does `Array.prototype.fill` work? Is it destructive? How can we find out?

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.fill(1, 1, 5);
```

### Solution:
From the method's documentation, it changes elements in an array to a single
value, optionally from a start index to an end index. If end index it omitted,
the method will change all values to the end of the array, and if the start
index is omitted, the method will change all values from the start of the array.

This invocation of `fill` has `1` as the value, `1` as the start index, and `5`
as the end index. Therefore, it will change each of `arr`'s elements from index
`1` to index `5` (which for this array is all the way to the end).

After calling `fill`, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

This method is destructive, and we can find out by inspecting `arr`'s value
after the method call. Its contents have changed.
