# JS110 Lesson 1
## Practice Problems
### Question 3

What is the return value `map` in the following code? Why?

```js
[1, 2, 3].map(num => num * num;);
```

### Solution:
Unlike the previous example in Question 2, this example's callback returns a
value based on the argument it's given. Single line, single expression arrow
functions have an implied `return` statement.

The callback function defined here returns the value of its argument squared, so
`map` returns a new array containing each element squared: `[1, 4, 9]`.
