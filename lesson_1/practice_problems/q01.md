### Question 1

What is the return value of the `filter` method call below? Why?

```js
[1, 2, 3].filter(num => 'hi');
```

### Solution:
`Array.prototype.filter` takes a callback function as its argument that should
return a truthy or falsy value. `filter` uses the callback's return value to
determine whether to include each element in the result array.

The callback function provided here returns `hi` regardless of each element's
value. `hi` is a non-empty string, a truthy value in JavaScript, so `filter`
includes every element in the result array. `filter` returns a new array,
`[1, 2, 3]`.
