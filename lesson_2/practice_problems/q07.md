# JS110 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems

### Question 7

Given the following code, what will the final values of `a` and `b` be?

```js
let a = 2;
let b = [5, 8];
let arr = [a, b];

arr[0] += 2;
arr[1][0] -= a;
```

### Solution:

When `arr` is declared and initialized on line 3, its first element contains a
copy of `a`'s value, `2`, and its second element holds a reference to `b`'s
array, `[5, 8]`. On line 5, reassigning `arr`'s first element's value only
modifies `arr`'s array, it doesn't change `a`'s value. However, on line 6,
`arr`'s second element, its sub-array, `[5, 8]`, is modified. The sub-array's
first element is decremented by `a`'s value, `2`. Because `arr`'s second element
and `b` both reference the same array, `b`'s value also changes.

`a`'s final value is `2`, it isn't modified in the code above. `b`'s final value
is `[3, 8]`, it's first element has been changed from `5` to `3`.
